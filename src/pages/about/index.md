# About

**OpenData.je** is a project dedicated to making open data from Jersey, Channel Islands, easily accessible and developer-friendly. Whether you're a data enthusiast, researcher, or developer, our goal is to provide you with comprehensive data in a consistent, predictable format.

If you are a developer, check out our [API Documentation](/docs/getting-started) to get started.

<br/>

## Why?

The inspiration for this project comes from the challenges I’ve faced when working with government data in Jersey. The existing APIs often lack uniformity, offer little to no documentation, and aren’t very developer-friendly. I’ve also been motivated by platforms like [data.gg](https://data.gg), which showed me the potential of making data more accessible and useful.

We provide data in JSON format, with plans to support XML in the future. The data we offer comes from various sources:

|||
|-----------|---|
|**Government APIs**|Live data directly remapped from Government API endpoints|
|**Government Websites**|Live data that is scraped from Government websites when an API is not available|
|**Static Data**|Manually collected, sometimes through FOI (Freedom of Information) requests.|

## I'm not a developer!
That's okay, we are building out our features for non-developers. See [Charts](/charts) and the [Map](/map).
